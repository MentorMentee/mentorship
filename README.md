# Mentorship
Most successful people can point to one or more 
people that have been particularly important to 
their growth and development. These people are 
mentors.

Mentors can serve many purposes. Sometimes 
they will help an individual with immediate 
needs, helping them solve pressing problems, 
getting important information or learning a 
skill quickly. Other times it provides longer
term support and guidance. Regardless of the 
specific need being addressed, mentoring is 
a giving/receiving relationship for everyone 
involved. It is about helping each other to
expand and grow so that everyone wins.

## Mentor 
Mentor The mentor’s role is to share experience, 
insights and feedback that will guide the mentor 
in the achievement of his or her learning objectives. 
Listening plays an important part in the mentoring 
role – listening to understand the mentee’s goals
and to uncover key learning opportunities that 
support those goals.

## Mentee 
The mentee’s role is to manage the mentoring 
partnership. Since the partnership is focused 
on the mentee’s learning objectives, it is 
essential that potential mentees devote time 
to clarifying professional goals and identifying 
strengths that will promote the achievement 
of those goals and development areas that 
may be obstacles.

# How To Have An Efficient Conversation With A Mentor
Time is very limited for both mentor and mentee so the process of conversation must be made as effective as possible especially by the mentee. So before asking any question, do your homework well, do more research, learn from various sources, and finally ask the mentor. 

Ask the question clearly by providing as much information and reference possible so that the mentor understands the question precisely. Some tips below:

**What are the problems that you are facing?**
Write a clear and concise description of what you think should have happened and what actually happened.

**How would you solve the problems?**
Write a clear and concise description of any alternative solutions that you've considered.

**Additional context that you would like to add.**
