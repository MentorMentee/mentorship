Most successful people can point to one or more 
people that have been particularly important to 
their growth and development. These people are 
mentors.

Mentors can serve many purposes. Sometimes 
they will help an individual with immediate 
needs, helping them solve pressing problems, 
getting important information or learning a 
skill quickly. Other times it provides longer
term support and guidance. Regardless of the 
specific need being addressed, mentoring is 
a giving/receiving relationship for everyone 
involved. It is about helping each other to
expand and grow so that everyone wins.


## Mentee 
The mentee’s role is to manage the mentoring 
partnership. Since the partnership is focused 
on the mentee’s learning objectives, it is 
essential that potential mentees devote time 
to clarifying professional goals and identifying 
strengths that will promote the achievement 
of those goals and development areas that 
may be obstacles.

## Mentor 
Mentor The mentor’s role is to share experience, 
insights and feedback that will guide the mentor 
in the achievement of his or her learning objectives. 
Listening plays an important part in the mentoring 
role – listening to understand the mentee’s goals
and to uncover key learning opportunities that 
support those goals.
