# So what happens now?
You and me, @codeanit, will have a conversation to get to know you a bit more.

We will set a date for audio/video conversation via Linkedin chat.

Mentor will take note such as 
- Mentee's  area of interest.
- Mentee's level of understanding in the area (Beginner/Intermediate/Advance).
- A programming language is chosen for the mentorship.

Mentor will create repository for the mentee where all the progress will be saved.

And these notes will be commented in this issue.
