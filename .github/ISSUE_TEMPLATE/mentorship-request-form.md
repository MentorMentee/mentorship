You and I, will have a conversation to get to know each other a bit more.

We will set a date for audio/video conversation via Linkedin chat.

I will take note such as 
- Your area of interest.
- Your level of understanding in the area (Beginner/Intermediate/Advance).
- And we will choose a programming language for the mentorship.

I will create a repository for you where all the progress will be stored.

And these notes will be commented in this issue.
